# multivariate_GWAMA

Nweighted GWAMA is a R based software function that performs a multivariate GWAMA of genetically correlated traits while correcting for sample overlap. The details of the method is described in Baselmans et al. (Nature Genetics) http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41588-018-0320-8

* The current version is 1_2_3

# Getting Started

You can source the function via:
```source("https://github.com/baselmans/multivariate_GWAMA/blob/master/Downloads/N_weighted_GWAMA.function.1_2_3.R?raw=TRUE")```
 
Or alternatively, you can download the function in the folder Downloads

# Requirements

The Nweighted GWAMA function requiers currently one R package to be installed. This is the package data.table (https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/data.table/index.html)  

With this package installed, you should be all set to install and use the Nweighted GWAMA function.

# How to run tests

A couple of data examples can be found in the Downloads directory. The sample size for these test datasets is 100,000

# Using the Nweighted software function

To run the Nweighted function some steps are requiered. 

1. The included summary statistics needs to be formatted with the following columns in the exact same order:
   SNPID,CHR,BP,EA,OA,EAF,N,Z,PVAL
 ```  
   SNPID = RS number
   CHR = chromosome
   BP = base pair
   EA = effect allele
   OA = other allele
   EAF = frequency effect allele
   N = sample size
   Z = z-score
   P = p-value
```   
   Thus, the included files needs exactly 9 columns

2. Make an empty list according to the number of input files:
   For instance: dat<-vector("list",4)
   
   Read in the data:
   dat[[1]]<-fread("path_to_files",showProgress=F,data.table=F)
   dat[[2]]<-fread("path_to_files",showProgress=F,data.table=F)
   dat[[3]]<-fread("path_to_files",showProgress=F,data.table=F)
   dat[[4]]<-fread("path_to_files",showProgress=F,data.table=F)
   
3. To correct for the sample overlap a matrix including the cross trait intercepts (CTI), gained from LD Score Regression (Bulik-          Sullivan, Nature Genetics 2015) is requierd.
   
   These Crostrait intercepts can be found in the log files provided by LD Score Regression (genetic correlation)
   The output is looking like:
   
   Summary	of	Genetic	Correlation	Results							
   p1	p2	rg	se	z	p	h2_obs	h2_obs_se	h2_int	h2_int_se	gcov_int	gcov_int_se

   The value listed under gcov_int is needed for the Cross Trait Intercept
   
   A CTI matrix could look like:
```  	
         T1	 T2     T3    T4
T1	 1       0.1282	 0.0126	 0.0236
T2	 0.1282	 1       0.2189	 0.1605
T3	 0.0126	 0.2189	 1	      0.3474
T4	 0.0236	 0.1605	 0.3474	 1
```
4.  A vector of the SNP heritabilities of the included traits needs to be included
    For instance: h2list <- c(0.0498, 0.0441, 0.0708, 0.0294)

* Note, The CTI values and the SNP heritabilies needs to be in the exact same order as you list the GWAS summary statistics.

# Run the Nweighted function
  multivariate_GWAMA(x=dat,cov_Z=CTI,h2=h2list,out=".",name="your_name",output_gz=F,check_rows=F)
  
  The function provides a log file including all the different steps (e.g. aligning) and possible errors.
